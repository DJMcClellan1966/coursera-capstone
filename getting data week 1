Title: Yelp Dataset Challenge
Introduction:
Yelp connects people to great local businesses. To help people find great local businesses, Yelp
engineers have developed an excellent search engine to sift through over 61 million reviews and
help people find the most relevant businesses for their everyday needs.
Yelp is proud to introduce a deep dataset for research minded academics from our wealth of
data. If youâ€™ve been looking for a rich set of data to train your models on and use in publications,
this is it. Tired of using the same standard datasets? Want some real world relevance in your
research project? This data is for you!
How well can you guess a review's rating from its text alone? Can you take all of the reviews of a
business and predict when it will be the most busy, or when the business is open? Can you
predict if a business is good for kids? Has WiFi? Has Parking? What makes a review useful,
funny, or cool? Can you figure out which business a user is likely to review next? How much of a
business's success is really just location, location, location? What businesses deserve their own
subcategory (i.e., Szechuan or Hunan versus just "Chinese restaurants"), and can you learn this
from the review text? What makes a tip useful? What are the differences between the cities in the
dataset? There is a myriad of deep, machine learning questions to tackle with this rich dataset.
